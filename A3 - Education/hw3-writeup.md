# Education Data Analysis

## 1. Do you think the bar chart for `bar_chart_high_school` is an effective data visualization?
I do not think that it is an effective data visualization. I say this becase the scale of the Y axis makes it hard to observe the small differences between genders. 


## 2. How and why did you choose the `plot for plot_hispanic_min_degree`?
I created a line plot that showed both degree options of hispanic students. 
I choose this as my plot as I was able to separate the degree types and show their changes over the time(x) while also showing their percentages.

## 3. Describe a possible bias present in this dataset and why it might have occurred.
One example of bias that is in our data set is the idea of historical bias as the data catagories of race are systematically oppressed historically in our society.
Additionally, under-representation bias exists as the website this was collected from reports that N/A values
occured when "Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient of variation (CV) is
50 percent or greater." This shows definite bias in our data.


## 4. Describe an application, analysis, or decision motivated by this dataset with the intended goal of improving educational equity but that ultimately exacerbates social injustice.
I think that the biggest damage that could happen from this data is the data on hispanic individuals as the data lacks input on them stating "1 Includes persons of Hispanic ethnicity for years prior to 1980."
This shows that any analysis on the hispanic column is hard to make conclusions from as they were included in black and white columns until 1980.
if for example a congress person suggested a grant for hispanic individuals and was shut down for an overall growth in percentage could be stopped by the data as the real results arent shown due to the 1980 exception.
This could also be said for the totals if we wanted to help another gender but we don't know which is most impactful as non binary identifying individuals arent represented.
