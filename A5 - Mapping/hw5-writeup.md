# Food Desert Analysis

## What is one way that government officials could use `plot_food_access_by_county` or `plot_low_access_tracts` to shape public policy on how to improve food access?
Goverment officials coult utilize these plots to identify counties to give
additional support to the counties struggling with food access. Additionaly,
the plots could highlight which county officials need to be made aware of
this issue as many of the places outlined are not just urban or rural but a mix
of both highlighting the severity of the issue.


## What is a limitation or concern with using the plots in this way?
One concern facing the plots is that there is not enough data to prove this as
there are a number of missing values in our data which could bring into queston the
validity of the plots and their results. Additionaly, there runs a risk of underrepresentation 
bias for the data as a county tht may not be facing inequality could in fact be in need of govermental support.
